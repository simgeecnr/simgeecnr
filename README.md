### Projects

This repository showcases a selection of my academic and applied projects, highlighting expertise in **probabilistic modeling, machine learning, time series analysis, and NLP**. Key projects include:

- **[Predictive Maintenance: RUL Estimation](https://github.com/simgeecnr/CMAPSS-Project) — December 2025**  
  _Supervised Learning, Time Series Analysis, TensorFlow, LSTM_  
  - Explored failure patterns in the CMAPSS FD001 dataset using multivariate sensor time-series data.  
  - Proposed a sequence-based KNN algorithm using combined Euclidean and Cosine distances to capture both temporal and threshold degradation patterns, offering full interpretability.  
  - Achieved strong performance (RMSE: 25.75), approaching state-of-the-art LSTM models (RMSE: 23.09) while maintaining complete model transparency.  

- **[Instantaneous Frequency Estimation Using MCMC and Gaussian Processes](https://github.com/simgeecnr/Masters-Thesis/tree/main) — June 2025**  
  _Probabilistic ML, Bayesian Statistics, Gaussian Processes (GP), MCMC, SDE, JAX_  
  - Developed a Bayesian GP + MCMC model to estimate instantaneous frequency of non-stationary chirp signals.  
  - Modeled the posterior distribution of the latent function rather than point estimates, enhancing robustness in noisy conditions (tested at 10 dB SNR).  
  - Outperformed classical methods (Hilbert transform, STFT) in RMSE while quantifying uncertainty.  

- **[News Classification with DistilBERT vs. Traditional ML](https://github.com/simgeecnr/732A81-Text-Mining-Project) — January 2025**  
  _PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, DistilBERT, NLP_  
  - Compared DistilBERT with traditional models (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression) on the AG News dataset.  
  - Evaluated model performance by fine-tuning DistilBERT and optimizing baselines across dataset sizes.  
  - DistilBERT outperformed classical models, particularly in low-data settings.
